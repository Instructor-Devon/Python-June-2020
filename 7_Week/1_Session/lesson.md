# Week 7 Session 1
## Django Deployment
What we will essentially be doing:
1) Renting a computer from Amazon (AWS) for hosting our web-server
2) Connecting to this computer through our Terminals
3) Installing the necessary development software to this computer
4) Cloning (from github) our project that we will to deploy
5) Running our Django application as a "background" service (gunicorn)
6) Routing http traffic coming in to this computer's IP, to our Django application (nginx)
## New Concepts/Skills

    - file systems
    - package management

## NOTE
This stuff can take a lot of time/repetition to understand completely.  That's okay!  I will be following the steps in the platform to a T, and do my best to explain everything along the way.
