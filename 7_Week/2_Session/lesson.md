# Week 7 Session 2
## Belt Prep Session : Strategies and DB Design
Let's take a look at some helpful strategies for attacking the belt exam, and get some practice designing databases from wireframes.

We will be:
- Looking at a few wireframe examples, coming up with a DB design that will support the feature set
- Building out one of the wireframes, as if it were a belt exam
- Focusing on the most difficult features first, and doing so in a way to get at the hard stuff ASAP.
