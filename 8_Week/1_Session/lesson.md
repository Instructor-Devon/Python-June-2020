# Week 8 Session 1
## Django Admin and Exam Recap
Let's dig into the Admin feature for Django, then dive into the Weekend's Belt Exam together

We will be:
- Seeing how to add/edit/update db entries with Django Admin
- Build the weekend's belt exam together, to both see how all of the Black Belt features could be implemented, and give a boost to those looking to get over the hump
